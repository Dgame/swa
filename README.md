# SWA Project

In this project I've implemented intentionally the following Flaws:

 - Earn or give, but never assume, trust
 - Use an authentication mechanism that cannot be bypassed or tampered with
 - Authorize after you authenticate
 - Strictly separate data and control intructions, and never process control instructions received from untrusted sources
 - Always consider the Users
